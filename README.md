The _Food Journal Tracker_ app is an React native mobile application that can be used to capture photos and information about what you eat. Keeping track of the food you eat is a proven way to make better diet choices. As an added benefit, many popular mobile apps - including Instagram - work in a similar way to the food journaling app.

- The user can take a photo of whatever they are eating or drinking using their phone inbuilt camera.
- The user can then add a description of the food to accompany the photo.
- The user can browse through all the photos and descriptions they have added by swiping up or down.

You can also:

- Import and save files from your phone local storage or gallery.
- Delete and update journals.
- Filter by category.

Remember what you've been eating in the last few days and identify healthy and unhealthy eating patterns.
